Hello to everyone who's reading this &hearts;
1st of all thanks for spending your times watching my lines of code!
Im Christian
I'm a Sicilian-based student of digital humanities (LM-43) in Catania, who recently got way (and way) more into programming. 
On 8th of september i started a Web Development course online, and i am really getting into it, as you can see those are my projects from the very begging of coding (9 september) and some personal tasks to learn i made up.
